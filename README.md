# The-Gaming-Room

    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The Gaming Room's *Draw it or Lose it* is a multi-platform application in a distributed environment where clients access a web-hosted application via internet protocols. Through developing this design document, I've learnt the importance of design documents, int that it is simply not possible to progess developing software without eventually reaching a dead-end and having to start over. While I believethe overall writing of the document was well done, if time limitations were lifted, I would have done more in-depth research on the topics discussed, and included more details in the document.
